**YAMM** is a custom memory management library designed to handle efficient memory allocation and deallocation within the Nex ecosystem. YAMM is intended to provide low-level, high-performance memory control, optimized initially for x86 assembly, with plans for ARM and RISC-V support in future versions.

## Getting Started

**NOTE:** CURRENTLY, YAMM IS INTEGRATED AND USED SOLELY AS A MODULE FOR THE [NEX COMPILER](https://github.com/nex-lang/compiler). Stay tuned for updates on installation instructions and [documentation](https://nex-lang.web.app/docs/extra/) as YAMM continues to evolve.
